# ERR1 uses a field that's not defined in our space 'not_def' should be underlined.
# ERR2 opcd5 in the mask is checked against a valid binary number but the binary has too many
#bits!  the number should have a warning indicating there are more bits defined than the field has available.
# ERR3 AA is checked against 0b5 which is an invalid binary number.  0b5 should be underlined.
# ERR4 tries to reference a field name not defined in this space.  Needs to access that register
# by first naming the space then referencing the field `$reg;SPR22;lsb
