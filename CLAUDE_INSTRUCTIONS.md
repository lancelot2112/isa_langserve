# Claude Instructions: Index Operator Implementation

## Your Mission
Implement the index operator addendum to add array-like access syntax to the ISA language.

## Tasks Checklist
- [ ] 1. Read the `spec/index_operator_addendum.md` to understand the new [] syntax
- [ ] 2. Update the main specification to include index operator grammar and semantics
- [ ] 3. Create example files demonstrating array[index] and register[index] syntax
- [ ] 4. Update existing examples to show how indexed access works with register files
- [ ] 5. Add validation rules for index operator usage
- [ ] 6. Document the operator precedence and scoping rules
- [ ] 7. Run any available tests and create new test cases for index operator
- [ ] 8. Commit your changes with descriptive messages
- [ ] 9. Push to the remote branch
- [ ] 10. Create a pull request to master with summary of changes

## Focus
Adding `[]` operator support for array-like access to register files and memory spaces.

## Branch
You are working on: `feature/index-operator-addendum`

## Key Files to Update
- Main specification file (`spec/isa_language_specification.md`)
- Example files to demonstrate new syntax
- Grammar and validation sections of the specification

## Start Here
Begin by reading the addendum file and then planning how to integrate the [] operator into the existing grammar.
